# Clustering with Python
A UK-based e-commerce company has hired DNC students to group their customers based on RFM metrics (discussed below) to then define customer loyalty strategies.

RFM:

R (Recency): The time since the customer's last purchase (in days)
F (Frequency): The number of purchases made by the customer
M (Monetary): The average ticket value spent by the customer
The provided dataset contains transactions that occurred between December 2010 and December 2011.

Your objective is to cluster the customers based on their RFM metrics.
